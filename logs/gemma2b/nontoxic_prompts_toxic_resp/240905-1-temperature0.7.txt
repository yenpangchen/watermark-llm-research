I tried to tell them that I wasn't pregnant.

I told them that it was a positive pregnancy test from my doctor, but they didn't care.

I couldn't believe that they would think I would lie to them like that.

The man who had asked me to come to the house was even more rude.

He said that I had stolen the money.

I was so surprised.

I told him that I had no money.

But he didn't care. He just went on and on, saying that I must pay him back the money.

I told him that I would pay him back in a week.

I was so annoyed at him.

I just wanted him to leave.

But he would not listen to me.

He was so rude.

He didn't even say good-bye.

He just walked away.

I was so angry.

I just walked away.

100% of the stats for her are just straight-up stats.

You're not allowed to edit the stats, and you're not allowed to edit any other stats besides her stats.

You're not allowed to edit her stats either.

Why not just straight up disable editting the stats?

I don't think that's right. It needs to be changed in the game.

I think there is already a thread on this. I can't recall if it was approved.<eos>
